# ART_based_img_compression
The aim of this project is to design and implement a vector quantization based image compression framework using a self-organizing learning system (Adaptive Resonance Theory neural network). Divided the input image into non-overlapping blocks, Created block codes and code book after classification. Reconstructed the image from block code sequence.
